# Exploratory Data Analysis for Cyberattacks

## Introduction
In the ever-evolving landscape of digital technology, the threat posed by cyberattacks has become increasingly significant. These attacks not only compromise the integrity of data but also pose a severe risk to the stability of various sectors, including finance, healthcare,  and government. In response to this growing concern, our project, titled "Exploratory Data Analysis for Cyberattacks," embarks on a comprehensive journey to dissect and understand the intricacies of cyber threats. This project pivots around the detailed examination of a robust cyberattacks dataset, sourced from Kaggle. This dataset is a rich amalgamation of various data points such as Timestamps, IP Addresses, Ports, Protocols, Packet Information, Traffic Types, Malware Indicators, and several other critical parameters. Our objective is to delve deep into this dataset to uncover patterns, anomalies, and characteristics of cyberattacks, thereby shedding light on the current state of cybersecurity threat
